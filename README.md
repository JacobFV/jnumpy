Jacob's numpy library for machine learning

## Getting started

1. Install from `pip` or clone locally:

```bash
$ pip install jnumpy
```

2. Import the `jnumpy` module.

```python
import jnumpy as jnp
```

## Limitations and Future Work

Version 2.0 is under development (this branch) and will feature:
- static execution graphs
- a keras-style neural network API with `fit`, `evaluate`, and `predict` and premade layers
- richer collections of optimizers, metrics, and losses
- more examples

Also maybe for the future:
- custom backends (i.e.: tensorflow or pytorch instead of numpy)
